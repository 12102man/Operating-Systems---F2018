Output 1:
Hello
Hello

Output 2:
Hello


This happens because printf content gets buffered before \n symbol. 
In case 1 "Hello" is getting printed twice, because it gets buffered in parent process and gets called twice% from child one and parent one. 
In case 2 buffer gets cleaned after \n and "Hello" is printed twice.
